## Terms

The crowdsale campaign will last 5 weeks. The first week is a "pre-sale" week. During the presale we want to attract larger-than-average investors by offering a solid bonus in exchange for a minimal contribution. The EAT tokens are not transferrable during the crowdsale. Transfers will be enabled by us within one week after the crowdsale ends.

### Token price structure

The base rate of the EAT token is set to 50 EAT per 1 ETH.

Addditionaly bonuses apply according to the following scheme

| Phase |	Duration | Bonus % | Minimal contribution | EAT/ETH |
| ----- | --------- | ------- | -------------------- | ---- |
| Presale | 1 week or until 200000 EAT tokens are sold | +30% | 5 ETH | 70 |
| Bonus 1 | 1 week  | +15% | 0.1 ETH | 60 |
| Bonus 2 | 1 week  | +10% | 0.1 ETH | 55 |
| Base | 1 week  | 0% | 0.1 ETH | 50 |

50% of the incoming ETH is immediately forwarded to our operational wallet to cover costs of ongoing development and marketing work.

50% are held in the crowdsale contract until the crowdsale is over.

### Contribution

The address sending ETH to the Crowdsale contract will receive the EAT tokens.
The EAT tokens are not transferrable during the crowdsale. Transfers will be enabled by us within one week after the crowdsale ends.

### Token Generation

Tokens are generated as ETH comes in. There is no limit for the total amount of tokens that can be generated during crowdsale. 

After the crowdsale ends we generate an additional
	- 10% of the sold tokens for the promotion team
	- 20% of the sold tokens as a reserve 

After team and reserve tokens are generated the token is finalized i.e. generation is irreversibly disabled by the crowdsale contract.
